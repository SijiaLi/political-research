# political-research

This project is a collaboration between Professor James Katz, college of communication and BU statistics department. 

This research is based on a survey data collected among more than three hundred BU freshmen before the 2017 US presidential election. The aim is to investigate the young generationâ€™s attitude towards the presidential election, including dating preference with someone who's having a different political view, and the possibility of experiencing discriminant events as a result of the election.
